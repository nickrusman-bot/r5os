# Third-party notices

Readable list for users and release builds. The rules are `docs/LICENSING.md`. This is not a complete bill of materials for the Haiku tree or for every package inside an R5OS image. Components that have not been inspected are unresolved, not MIT.

## Haiku

R5OS is an independent system based on Haiku. Haiku’s own copyright notices and licenses stay on Haiku’s files. Much of Haiku is MIT; the tree is not all MIT. This repository does not relicense it.

## Identified in this repository

### AirPlay receiver

Location: `distro/airplay`.

| Piece | Project | License |
|---|---|---|
| RAOP / classic AirPlay flow | Shairport (James Laird), Shairport Sync (Mike Brady) | MIT |
| ALAC decoder | David Hammerton | MIT |
| AES-128-CBC | kokke tiny-AES-c | Unlicense |
| RSA and Apple-Challenge | OpenSSL 3 from HaikuPorts (`libcrypto`) | OpenSSL 3’s license (Apache-2.0 for OpenSSL 3) |

Copyright, URLs, and what was not copied (AirPlay 2 pairing, NQPTP, FairPlay) are in `distro/airplay/THIRD_PARTY.md`.

The MIT text used for covered files is `LICENSES/MIT.txt`. The Unlicense text is `LICENSES/Unlicense.txt`. The Apache-2.0 text is not in `LICENSES/` yet.

R5OS-owned source in this tree is GPL-3.0-or-later where the file is ours as a whole. The list of those paths, and the Haiku files that stay on their own license, is in `docs/LICENSING.md`.

## Built outside this repository, not in the image

### VirtualBox Guest Additions 7.2.22

Oracle VirtualBox 7.2.22 Haiku additions. License: GPL-3.0-only. Some IPRT files are GPL-3.0-only OR CDDL-1.0; we take the GPL-3.0-only choice. The Oracle tarball is not in git. The R5OS build fixes are `distro/vbox-guest/virtualbox-7.2.22-r5os.patch`. The binaries are not in git. The daily image installs them, plus the unmodified GNU GPL version 3 and that source, at `/boot/system/non-packaged/data/licenses/virtualbox`. They are not MIT.

The “or later” name on `LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt` is the grant for new R5OS code. It is not added to the VirtualBox sources. Haiku’s MIT notices stay on the Haiku files. See `docs/LICENSING.md` and `distro/vbox-guest/README.md`.

### OpenGL stack on the image

Location: `distro/packages/x86_64`. Copied onto the image after jam. Mesa 22.0.5 is removed from that image.

| Piece | Project | License |
|---|---|---|
| `libglvnd` 1.7.0 (`libGL.so.1`) | NVIDIA, 2013 | MIT |
| Mesa 25.3.6 llvmpipe (`libEGL_mesa.so.0`) and Lavapipe | Brian Paul and others | MIT |
| `libLLVM.so.21.1` only | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2003-2025 | Apache-2.0 with LLVM exception |
| Vulkan loader 1.4.367 | The Khronos Group Inc. | Apache-2.0 |
| vulkaninfo 1.4.367 (`vulkan_tools`) | The Khronos Group Inc., Valve Corporation, LunarG, Inc., RasterGrid Kft. | Apache-2.0 |

The LLVM license text shipped inside the runtime package is `LICENSES/Apache-2.0-with-LLVM-exception.txt`. These packages were not audited file by file. This is CPU drawing, not the graphics chip.

### Manrope

Location: `distro/fonts/manrope`. Installed on the image at `data/settings/fonts` and loaded by Settings only.

| Piece | Project | License |
|---|---|---|
| `manrope-regular.ttf`, `manrope-bold.ttf` | Manrope, Mikhail Sharanda, 2018. Mirko Velimirovic and Mikhail Sharanda made the variable family in 2019. These two files are the unmodified static fonts from `googlefonts/manrope`. | OFL-1.1 |

Copyright line in the font's license file: Copyright 2018 The Manrope Project Authors (https://github.com/googlefonts/manrope). No Reserved Font Name is declared after that line. The files are not modified, so the name stays Manrope. `OFL.txt` and `FONTLOG.txt` ship next to the fonts. The SPDX text is `LICENSES/OFL-1.1.txt`. The same files are installed under `data/fonts/ttfonts`. app_server uses Manrope Regular and Bold as the default plain and bold fonts when the user has not saved a font choice. The fixed font stays Noto Sans Mono. Noto Sans remains the fallback if Manrope is missing.

## Not included

Linux DRM and `amdgpu` are not imported.

## Not done

Credits & Licenses inside About R5OS is not built. It must be generated from this inventory once the image actually contains the components it names. A full scan of `haiku/`, firmware, fonts, and package dependencies is still open.
